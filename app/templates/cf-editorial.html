      <h1>Title goes here</h1>
      <p>Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n ≥ 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.

As Mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n1 + n2 + … + nk = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can’t make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition ni ≥ 2 should hold for all i from 1 to k.

Ostap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts.</p>

    <p>One can come to a conclusion easily that the tax becomes minimal when we represent Mr. Funt’s income as the sum of the largest possible primes. Primes, as with the maximal divisor as 1, stand as the best in for tax minimisation.

Hence, if the input is prime, the output is 1. How to check if a number is prime?</p>
